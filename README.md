# cervical_spine_fracture_identification
Projection-driven multi-stage framework for cervical spine fracture identification from CT. Uses optimized 2D orthogonal projections to approximate 3D vertebra VOIs and classifies them via an ensemble 2.5D CNN-Transformer. Evaluated on RSNA 2022 with patient-wise 5-fold CV and strict leakage prevention.
